            icon aspired to be an actor, but fate had other “designs” for him. The icon's popularity peaked in 2000 when he won the award for Best International Designer.
            <hr class="clanok3"></li>

            <li><h3> Pierre Cardin</h3>
            The Italian-born Frenchman is praised for his 20thcentury pieces that exuded a futuristic flair. As Pierre Cardin rose to fame in the age of the space race, his creations 
            embodied the perfect touch of innovation, inventiveness, and modishness. His 'bubble dresses' radiated science fiction, combining earthly elegance with out-of-this-world colors and avant-garde design.

    <div class="graf">
        <h3 class="brands-h3">Here are five reasons why people buy expensive high-fashion brands:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>Prestige and social status: </h4>High-fashion brands are often seen as symbols of social status and prestige. 
                Wearing luxury clothing or accessories signals success and wealth, which can boost the wearer's confidence and their perception by others.</li>
            <li><h4>Quality and craftsmanship: </h4>Expensive brands pride themselves on using high-quality materials and meticulous 
                craftsmanship. Many luxury pieces are handmade or produced with special techniques, ensuring durability and unique design.</li>
            <li><h4>Exclusivity and limited editions:</h4> High-fashion brands frequently produce limited collections or items available in small quantities. 
                Owning something rare and exclusive gives a sense of uniqueness and individuality.</li>
            <li><h4>Expression of personal style and individuality: </h4>Luxury fashion allows people to express their personal taste and style. For many, 
                it's a form of art and self-expression, where high-fashion items serve as a way to stand out from mass-market fashion.</li>
            <li><h4>Investment for the future: </h4>Some people view buying expensive fashion as an investment. Many high-fashion brands retain or even increase in value over time, 
                especially iconic or rare pieces. This way, luxury clothing or accessories can appreciate and be sold at a higher value in the future.</li>
